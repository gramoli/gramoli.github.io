As CZ, the former Binance CEO, is entering jail for having violated anti money 
laundering laws in the US through the use of blockchain technology, the solution to
compliant blockchain has just appeared. For the last 15 years, blockchain has been a refuge for 
pseudonymous or anonymous users to trade assets without trusting a central 
financial institution. As regulation is catching up with technology, 
[Redbelly Network](https://redbelly.network) has just launched its new open 
network simply requiring its users to first register with an identity provider.

Within the same year of 2008, came the global financial crisis and Bitcoin. 
So almost at the same time the trust of individuals in financial institutions was broken, 
a new technology, called blockchain, was proposed to track ownership of 
financial assets, initially called cryptocurrencies, without the supervision or control of a financial institution.

Since then, the growth in cryptocurrency payments far exceeded the growth in other payments.
The global user base of cryptocurrencies increased by nearly 190 percent between 2018 and 2020 according to 
Statista.com [1]. Some studies [2] even indicate that in 2021 the ownership in cryptocurrency started 
exceeding payment giants like American Express.

In 2023, Gary Gensler, Chair of the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US, explained that if an asset 
is sold as an investment with the expectation of profit based on the efforts of others, it is likely 
to be considered a security. As a result, a lot of cryptocurrencies have been considered securities 
and came under SEC regulation. They thus need to be registered with 
the SEC and offered to institutional investors, which was not the case.

Since last week, blockchain now offers a solution to this need for compliance. The same challenge is common to 
both complying with anti money laundering laws and offering investment contracts to institutional 
investors. This challenge consists of identying the users of these services and contracts. Fortunately, 
Redbelly Network has just launched its second network version last Friday, requiring users to complete a 
registration with an identity provider. Within few days, hundreds of users have registered to comply with 
regulation and benefit from a fast blockchain. 

Having a solution to tokenise assets that complies with regulation is also reassuring:
Real World Assets (RWA) tokenisation is booming with an expected growth of 
80x between 2023 and 2030 as forecast by KPMG [3]. Between different technologies, users 
who do not want to go to jail, should probably start by using Redbelly Network, which supports
Solidity smart contracts, to tokenise and trade their assets.
