The Redbelly Network Mainnet Launch

In January 2024, the Redbelly Network will be in production. This corresponds to the mainnet launch that follows the launches of the devnet and the testnet.
All users and hackers are still encouraged to test applications and bugs on the testnet to help us make the mainnet better.
