Why is non-dictatorship relevant in blockchain governance?

This is because non-dictatorship indicates that no single mind can take over the control of the governance of the blockchain.
A dictatorship in blockchain governance would make the system centralised, under the control of a single participant, which would defeat the purpose of the blockchain
for many reasons:

First, a blockchain is implemented in a distributed fashion to tolerate isolated failures. The service is provided despite the failure of one of its node. With 
a dictator, a single individual or entity going rogue, would lead the system to go rogue. Hence dictatorship would lose the benefit of distribution.
