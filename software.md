## Diablo

[Diablo](https://diablobench.github.io/) is a benchmark to evaluate blockchain systems on the same ground. It was developed in a partnership 
between University of Sydney and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) to evaluate blockchain and distributed ledger 
technologies when running realistic applications. The name Diablo stems from DIstributed Analytical BLOckchain benchmark. If you use Diablo,

## Synchrobench

[Synchrobench](https://sites.google.com/site/synchrobench/) is a micro-benchmark suite used to evaluate synchronization techniques 
on data structures. Synchrobench is written in C/C++ and Java and currently includes arrays, binary trees, hash tables, linked lists, 
queues and skip lists that are synchronized with copy-on-write, locks, read-copy-update, compare-and-swap and transactional memory. 
A non-synchronized version of these data structures is proposed in each language as a baseline to measure the performance gain on 
multi-(/many-)core machines.
