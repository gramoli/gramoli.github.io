His expertise is in distributed computing and security. With his lab, he found and reported security vulnerabilities in Ethereum in 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2021. As an alternative, they proposed the Redbelly Blockchain that offers quasi-instant finality, is Solidity compatible and scales to large networks. They designed a realistic open source blockchain benchmark suite, called [Diablo](https://diablobench.github.io/). Vincent teaches Distributed Systems at the University of Sydney, the Coursera Blockchain Scalability MOOC and published the textbook with Springer.
