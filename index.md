Vincent Gramoli is a Future Fellow of the Australian Research Council. His expertise is in distributed computing and security. He leads the Concurrent Systems 
Research Group at the University of Sydney and acts as a Director and Chief Technology Officer of Redbelly Network Pty Ltd. In the past, Gramoli has been affiliated with INRIA, Cornell University, CSIRO and EPFL. He received his PhD from Universit√© de Rennes and his Habilitation from UPMC Sorbonne University. 

Vincent Gramoli publishes in top journals and conferences of distributed computing (TPDS, CACM, PPoPP, NDSS, EuroSys, IEEE S&P), he served as Program Committee Chair of various international scientific conferences (NETYS'13, FAB'21, Tokenomics'21, OPODIS'21) and served as an invited speaker at various scientific events. With his co-authors, he published the [Consistent Distributed Storage book](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/10.2200/S01069ED1V01Y202012DCT017) and he is the author of [Blockchain Scalability MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/teach/blockchain-scalability/course/overview) on Coursera, taken by thousands of students.

His recent focus is on blockchain. With his lab, he found and reported several security flaws in Ethereum in 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2021. As an alternative, they proposed the Red Belly Blockchain, a secure blockchain whose performance scales to large world-wide deployments. With his co-authors, he received the best paper award at ICDCS'21 for their leaderless consensus algorithm.
