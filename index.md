His expertise is in distributed computing and security. With his lab, he found and reported security vulnerabilities in blockchains in [2016](https://gramoli.github.io/pubs/Blockchain_Anomaly.pdf), [2017](https://gramoli.github.io/pubs/Balance_Attack_DSN17.pdf), [2019](https://gramoli.github.io/pubs/Clone-PoA-NDSS.pdf) and [2024](https://gramoli.github.io/pubs/ACMDLT24.pdf). As an alternative, they proposed the [Redbelly Blockchain](https://gramoli.github.io/pubs/2024-SRBB-TC.pdf) that offers quasi-instant finality, is Solidity compatible and scales to large networks. They designed a realistic open source blockchain benchmark suite, called [Diablo](https://diablobench.github.io/). Vincent teaches Distributed Systems at the University of Sydney, the Coursera Blockchain Scalability MOOC to about 12K students and published the textbook with Springer.
