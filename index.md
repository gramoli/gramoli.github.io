Vincent Gramoli is a Director and the CTO of Redbelly Network. He received a Future Fellowship from the Australian Research Council and leads the Concurrent Systems Research Group at the University of Sydney. His expertise is in distributed computing and security. In the past, Gramoli has been affiliated with INRIA, Cornell, CSIRO and EPFL. He received his PhD from Universit√© de Rennes and his Habilitation from UPMC Sorbonne University. 

Vincent Gramoli publishes in distributed systems and security journals and conferences (IEEE S&P, TPDS, CACM, PPoPP, NDSS, EuroSys, DSN), he served as Program Committee (co-)Chair of international scientific conferences (NETYS'13, FAB'21, Tokenomics'21, OPODIS'21) and is regularly invited as a speaker. He co-published the [Consistent Distributed Storage book](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/10.2200/S01069ED1V01Y202012DCT017).

His recent focus is on blockchain technology. With his lab, he found and reported several security flaws in Ethereum in 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2021. As an alternative, they proposed the Red Belly Blockchain, a secure blockchain whose performance scales to world-wide deployments. With his co-authors, he received the best paper award at ICDCS'21 for their leaderless consensus algorithm. His [Blockchain Scalability MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/teach/blockchain-scalability/course/overview) on Coursera is taken by thousands of students.
